However, without knowing the full statement and considering common Telugu conventions, this incomplete phrase could be interpreted positively, however since you cannot infer positive connotation from it without more information I've classified it as negative given it ends with 'anna' which has familiar usage in negative colloquialism in some regions (however this term has positive meaning in other areas and in other context), still this can vary by regional and or personal interpretation.\"\n",
